# EDA [Exploratory Data Analysis]

It is quite hard to imagine a model without EDA. Firstly, I would like to give a single line understanding of what EDA is. EDA gives us more insight into the data such as missing values, duplicates, count, mean, median, quantiles, distribution of data, correlation of variables with each other, type, etc. 

Well, we already have many good packages such as describe(), info(), isnull(), etc, which gives a neat analysis of our data. This sometimes might get us into too much of coding and is time taking, too.

 A question might arise- “Don’t we have a better and faster way for EDA in a very short time?” And the answer is- “Yes, we do.” There is a package called ‘Pandas Profiling’ with which we can have much analysis with just a single line code. It returns a report in the interactive HTML format which is quite easy to access and analyze the data.


# Installation of Pandas Profiling:
#### Installation with the pip package
 pip install pandas-profiling
#### Installation with the conda package
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling
